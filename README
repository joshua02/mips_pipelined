To run the simulator run the command

python mipssim.py INPUTFILENAME OUTPUTFILENAME

This will open INPUTFILENAME eg. t1.bin, t2.bin, t3.bin, or t4.bin
there is no support for files with different names because the code 
uses the name of the input file to determine what data to write to
the output

The OUTPUTFILENAME will be used to create a file OUTPUTFILENAME_sim.txt
which records the cycle number, instruction address, instruction as text,
the values of the registers, and the values in the data stack.

OUTPUTFILENAME_dis.txt is also created, it contains the raw binary
dissassembled into an instruction and parameters. The instructions
after the break are converted into signed numbers and stored in memory.
